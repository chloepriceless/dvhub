# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** server.js von 3,669 Zeilen auf ~500 Zeilen reduzieren durch Extraktion in 7 fokussierte Module bei 100% API-Kompatibilitaet
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation and Leaf Module

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation and Leaf Module) -- COMPLETE
Plan: 2 of 2 in current phase
Status: Phase 1 Complete
Last activity: 2026-03-26 -- Completed 01-02 user-energy-pricing extraction

Progress: [##########] 100% (Phase 1)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 8 min
- Total execution time: 0.27 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01 | 2/2 | 16 min | 8 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 9 min, 7 min
- Trend: stable

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Merged research Phase 0+1 into single Phase 1 (coarse granularity -- DI contract + leaf extraction form one delivery unit)
- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from dependency graph (leaf-first order mandatory)
- Roadmap: QUAL-01 through QUAL-05 are cross-cutting gates applied to every phase, not assigned to a single phase
- [Phase 01]: berlinDateString, localMinutesOfDay, gridDirection refactored to accept config params instead of closing over cfg
- [Phase 01]: Default param values match original cfg defaults (Europe/Berlin, feed_in) for backward compatibility
- [Phase 01]: configuredModule3Windows exported as public (not private helper) for userEnergyPricingSummary access
- [Phase 01]: DI context documented as commented-out template; will be activated in Phase 2
- [Phase 01]: resolveImportPriceCtKwhForSlot and slotComparison accept explicit timezone parameter

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 (Automation Core) is highest risk -- schedule-eval touches hardware via transport, has complex async chains. Needs deeper research during planning.
- system-discovery.test.js dynamically imports server.js -- needs analysis in Phase 1 to determine extraction impact.
- modbus-server.js depends on setForcedOff/clearForcedOff (belongs to schedule-eval). During Phase 2, these stay in server.js as callbacks; re-wired in Phase 4.
